# PageBlocker (Beta Version!)

This code blocks specific pages, which the user cann add! They have to be unlocked later on with a passwort!
This idea is just going to work if the others don't understand the way this code works, so dont tell anyone about it!

# How to use?

1.) Install Tampermonkey
2.) Add this script to it
3.) If you want to block a page, press ^
4.) Add a password 
5.) Press Tab to unlock the page again
6.) Enjoy!

DO NOT DELETE THE LOCALSTORAGE! 
I am working on an aprovement for this! 

Future Add-Ons:

1.) Save stuff saver 
2.) Add timer for page block
3.) dynamic passwort changer
